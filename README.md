# Indian-Sign-Language-To-Text-And-Speech-Interpreter
Sign Languages are a set of languages that use predefined actions and movements to convey a message. These languages are primarily developed to aid deaf and other verbally challenged people. They use a simultaneous and precise combination of movement of hands, orientation of hands, hand shapes etc. Different regions have different sign languages like American Sign Language, Indian Sign Language etc. We focus on Indian Sign language in this project.

Indian Sign Language (ISL) is a sign language that is predominantly used in South Asian countries. It is sometimes referred to as Indo-Pakistani Sign Language (IPSL). There are many special features present in ISL that distinguish it from other Sign Languages. Features like Number Signs, Family Relationship, use of space etc. are crucial features of ISL. Also, ISL does not have any temporal inflection.

In this project, we aim towards analyzing and recognizing various alphabets from a database of sign images. Database consists of various images with each image clicked in different light condition with different hand orientation. With such a divergent data set, we are able to train our system to good levels and thus obtain good results.

We investigate different machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and a neural network technique Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) for detection of sign language.
